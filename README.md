# FoodieFinder

## Brief Description
The FoodieFinder project aims to address the challenge of finding halal and vegan food options in Singapore’s hawker centers. Our approach involves web scraping, data cleaning, and implementing efficient search algorithms to provide users with personalized and accurate recommendations. We developed a web application featuring interactive search and navigation functionalities enhanced by the Trie data structure, Dijkstra's algorithm for route finding, Quick Sort for filtering, Sequential Search for sorting, and an Aggregation algorithm for reviews. The major findings include the successful identification and correction of data inconsistencies and the implementation of a responsive and user-friendly search experience.

## Contributions
- Developed the Dijkstra’s algorithm for optimal route finding
- Implemented the Haversine formula for distance calculations
- Built the interactive map and user interface (UI)

## Lessons Learnt
Gained a better understanding of how data structures work in real-world applications, especially in the context of search and navigation algorithms. Improved skills in integrating algorithms with web technologies and handling data cleaning challenges.

## User Manual
1. **Search for Food Stalls:** Use the search bar to find halal or vegan food stalls by name, location, or cuisine type.
2. **View Recommendations:** Get personalized recommendations based on your search criteria and preferences.
3. **Map Navigation:** Visualize stall locations on an interactive map and use the route finder to get directions within hawker centers.
4. **Filter and Sort:** Apply filters (e.g., ratings, distance) and sort results using the available options.
5. **Review Aggregation:** View aggregated reviews and ratings for each stall to make informed choices.
